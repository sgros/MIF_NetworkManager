        Use the 'Save' method on the connection to save these changes
        to disk. Note that unsaved changes will be lost if the
        connection is reloaded from disk (either automatically on file
        change or due to an explicit ReloadConnections call).

        is &quot;true&quot;, then this will have no real effect, but is
        harmless.) As with AddConnection(), this operation does not
        necessarily start the network connection.
