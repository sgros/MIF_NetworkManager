      Objects that implement the Connection.Active interface represent an attempt
      to connect to a network using the details provided by a Connection object.
      The Connection.Active object tracks the life-cycle of the connection
      attempt and if successful indicates whether the connected network is the
      &quot;default&quot; or preferred network for access.
      NetworkManager has the concept of connections, which can be thought of as
      settings, a profile or a configuration that can be applied on a networking
      device.
      Such settings-connections are exposed as D-Bus object and the active-connection
      expresses this relationship between device and settings-connection.
      At any time a settings-connection can only be activated on one device and vice
      versa. However, during activation and deactivation multiple active-connections
      can reference the same device or settings-connection as they are waiting to
      be activated or to be deactivated.
