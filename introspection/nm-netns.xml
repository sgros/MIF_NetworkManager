      The Settings interface allows clients to view and administrate a
      specific instance of network namespace controlled by NetworkManager.
    </tp:docstring>

    <method name="GetDevices">
      <tp:docstring>
        Get the list of realized network devices in the network namespace.
      </tp:docstring>
      <arg name="devices" type="ao" direction="out">
        <tp:docstring>
          List of object paths of network devices present in the network
          namespace. This list does not include device placeholders
          (see GetAllDevices()).
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </method>

    <method name="GetAllDevices">
      <tp:docstring>
        Get the list of all network devices in the network namespace.

      <annotation name="org.freedesktop.DBus.GLib.CSymbol" value="impl_netns_get_all_devices"/>
      <arg name="devices" type="ao" direction="out">
        <tp:docstring>
          List of object paths of network devices and device placeholders
          (eg, devices that do not yet exist but which can be automatically
          created by NetworkManager if one of their AvailableConnections
          was activated) in a given network namespace.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </method>

    <method name="TakeDevice">
      <tp:docstring>
        Take given device, i.e. move it to this network namespace.
      </tp:docstring>
      <arg name="device" type="o" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          Device that should be taken.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <arg name="timeout" type="i" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          Timeout in miliseconds to wait for the operation to complete.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </method>

    <method name="ActivateConnection">
      <tp:docstring>
        Activate a connection using the supplied device.
      </tp:docstring>
      <arg name="connection" type="o" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          The connection to activate.  If "/" is given, a valid device path must
          be given, and NetworkManager picks the best connection to activate for
          the given device.  VPN connections must always pass a valid connection
          path.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <arg name="device" type="o" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          The object path of device to be activated for physical connections.
          This parameter is ignored for VPN connections, because the
          specific_object (if provided) specifies the device to use.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <arg name="specific_object" type="o" direction="in">
        <tp:docstring>
          The path of a connection-type-specific object this activation should use.
          This parameter is currently ignored for wired and mobile broadband connections,
          and the value of "/" should be used (ie, no specific object).  For WiFi
          connections, pass the object path of a specific AP from the card's scan
          list, or "/" to pick an AP automatically.  For VPN connections, pass
          the object path of an ActiveConnection object that should serve as the
          "base" connection (to which the VPN connections lifetime will be tied),
          or pass "/" and NM will automatically use the current default device.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
      <arg name="active_connection" type="o" direction="out">
        <tp:docstring>
          The path of the active connection object representing this active connection.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </method>

    <method name="DeactivateConnection">
      <annotation name="org.gtk.GDBus.DocString" value="

    <property name="Name" type="s" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
      Name of the network namespace, as created in directory /var/run/netns.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Devices" type="ao" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        The list of realized network devices in the network namespace. Realized
        devices are those which have backing resources (eg from the kernel or a
        management daemon like ModemManager, teamd, etc).
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="AllDevices" type="ao" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        The list of both realized and un-realized network devices in the network
        namespace. Un-realized devices are software devices which do not yet
        have backing resources, but for which backing resources can be created
        if the device is activated.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="PrimaryConnection" type="o" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        The object path of the "primary" active connection being used
        to access the network. In particular, if there is no VPN
        active, or the VPN does not have the default route, then this
        indicates the connection that has the default route. If there
        is a VPN active with the default route, then this indicates
        the connection that contains the route to the VPN endpoint.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="PrimaryConnectionType" type="s" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        The connection type of the "primary" active connection being
        used to access the network. This is the same as the Type
        property on the object indicated by PrimaryConnection.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="ActivatingConnection" type="o" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        The object path of an active connection that is currently
        being activated and which is expected to become the new
        PrimaryConnection when it finishes activating.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Metered" type="u" access="read" tp:type="NM_METERED">
      <tp:docstring>
        Indicates whether the connectivity is metered. This is equivalent
        to the metered property of the device associated with the primary
        connection.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>
