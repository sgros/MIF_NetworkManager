NetworkManager-1.2
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.0
============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* Added an option to enable use of random MAC addresses for Wi-Fi access
    point scanning (defaults to disabled).  Controlled with
    'wifi.mac-address-randomization' property (MAC_ADDRESS_RANDOMIZATION key in
    ifcfg files).
* Wi-Fi scanning now utilizes wpa_supplicant's AP list.
* Added support for Wi-Fi powersave, configured with POWERSAVE key in ifcfg
    files.
* Added support for creation of more types of software devices: tun & tap,
    macvlan, vxlan and ip tunnels (ipip, gre, sit, ip6ip6 and ipip6).
* The software devices (bond, bridge, vlan, team, ...) can now be stacked
    arbitrarily.  The nmcli interface for creating master-slave relationships
    has been significantly improved by the use of 'master' argument to
    all link types.
* RFC7217 stable privacy addressing is now used by default to protect from
    address-based host tracking. The IPv6 addressing mode is configured with
    IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE key in ifcfg files.
* Improved route management code to avoid clashes between conflicting
    routes in multiple connections.
* Refactored platform code resulting in more robust interface to platform,
    less overhead and reduced memory footprint.
* Improved interoperability with other network management tools.  The
    externally created software devices are not managed until they're
    activated.
* The Device instances now exist for all software connections and the platform
    devices are now only created when the device is activated.  This makes it
    possible for connections with device of same name not to clash unless
    they're activated concurrently.  The links are now not unnecessarily present
    unless the connection is active, avoiding pollution of the link namespace.
* NetworkManager now correctly manages connectivity in namespace-based
    containers such as LXC and Docker.
* Support for configuring ethernet Wake-On-Lan has been added.
* Added LLDP listener functionality and related CLI client commands. Enabled via
    LLDP option in ifcfg files.
* CLI secret agent has been extended with support for VPN secrets.
* The command line client now utilizes colors for its output.
* The command line client now sorts the devices and properties for better
    clarity.
* Numerous improvements to Bash command completion for nmcli.
* NetworkManager relies on less external libraries.  The use of dbus-glib
    has been replaced with gio's native D-Bus support and libnl-route is no
    longer used.
* Dependency on avahi-autoipd has been dropped.  Native IPv4 link-local
    addressing configuration based on systemd network library is now used
    instead.
* Hostname is now managed via systemd-hostnamed on systemd-based systems.
* Management of resolv.conf management can be changed at runtime, private
    resolv.conf is always written in /run.
* NetworkManager can now write DNS options to resolv.conf.
* Updated version of systemd network library used for internal DHCP and
    IPv4 link-local support.
* Support for event logging via audit subsystem has been added.
* Support for native logging via systemd-journald has been added taking
    advantage of its structured logging.
* Live reconfiguration of IP configuration after changing the settings without
    reactivation of the device with "nmcli device reapply" command and via
    D-Bus API.
* The API for VPN plugins now supports multiple simultaneous connections.
    Most popular VPN plugins have been updated to support this functionality.
* The libnm library now provides API to access VPN service definitions.
* New DHCP_FQDN key in ifcfg files to configure the full FQDN to be sent to
    the DHCP servers.
* The timeout for DHCP requests can now be modified using the
    'ipv4.dhcp-timeout' property.
* Added multicast_snooping option to BRIDGING_OPTS ifcfg key.
* Added support for detecting duplicate IPv4 addresses, with a timeout
    configurable through the ipv4.dad-timeout connection property.
* Fixed a race condition that could potentially lead to unauthorized access
    to connection secrets (CVE-2016-0764).
* dnsmasq configuration for shared connections can now be extended by
    placing custom files in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq-shared.d/.
* Generic devices are no longer assumed unless explicitly requested by
    user.
* The reorder-header VLAN flag setting is now honored; to keep backwards
    compatibility in behavior, an existing REORDER_HDR=0 ifcfg-rh key is
    ignored; the flag must be disabled with VLAN_FLAGS=NO_REORDER_HDR.
* Fair amount of bugs was fixed and robustness was generally improved.

The following features were backported to 1.0.x releases from 1.0.0 to 1.0.10
are also present in NetworkManager-1.2:

* Added support for handling VPN secrets to nmtui and nmcli agent.
* The team devices can now properly be enslaved to bridges.
* Failed DHCP attempts for assumed connections are now retried after
    a timeout.
* Default wired connection is now created after udev registers the device.
* Support for Bluetooth DUN devices with Bluez 5 has been fixed.
* The 'ipv6.ignore-auto-dns' property is now properly honored making it
    possible to override automatically obtained name servers.
* Invalid permanent MAC addresses as reported by some devices are now
    ignored.
* Device links reported by more recent versions of Linux kernel that reside
    in different network namespaces are no longer confused with links in
    the namespace NetworkManager runs in.
* MAC address changes of bond or team devices are now properly propagated
    to VLANs created on the device.
* Fixed error handling for teaming devices with invalid configuration.
* Wi-Fi AP list is now updated correctly after AP mode has been used.
* The error handling for VPN secret agents is now significantly more robust.
* Detection of s390 CTC devices now works properly.
* A GATEWAY key in in /etc/sysconfig/network now no longer affects
    non-static connections.
* Added support for IPv6-only VPN connections.
* The systemd service now uses HUP signal to reload configuration.
* Change VLAN default flags to set REORDER_HDR for new connections.
* nmtui is now able to ignore automatically configured routes.
* Allow setting IPv6 and PPP settings for GDM and CDMA connections via
    nmcli.
* Added support for adding ADSL connections in nmcli.
* Improved capture portal detection.
* Default route through WiFi connection is now preferred to Mobile
    Broadband if both are available.
* Expose a flag to determine whether a particular connection is metered
    via API and client tools. Configurable in ifcfg with CONNECTION_METERED
    key.
* Add support for locking connections to a channel within a particular
    band.
* Add support for configuring Wake-on-LAN capabilitites.
* Allow overriding the MTU for team device.
* The MTU setting from an IPv6 neighbor discovery Router Advertisements is
    now ignored if applying it would result in invalid configuration.
* Some configuration options can now be changed without restarting the
    daemon. Notably, this applies to 'dns', 'connectivity' and
    'ignore-carrier' settings.
* The connection activation was made more robust. If an active connection
    is reactivated, the device it is active on takes precedence. If an attempt
    is made to activate a connection on a different device than the one it is
    active on, the activation proceeds removing the connection from the active
    device.
* The device specifiers in configuration files now support negation via
    'except:' match.
* Devices that only have IPv6 link-local address are no longer assumed to
    be connected.
* nmcli now provides hints and tab-completion for enumeration properties.
* If the IPv6 interface tokens are set they are honored when creating an
    interface identifier for IPv6 addressing.
* NetworkManager now maintains correct routing configuration when multiple
    interfaces are connected to the same network.
* The management of devices can now be controlled with udev rules. The veth
    devices as well as the virtual Ethernet devices of various
    virtualization tools (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels Workstation) are
    now ignored by default.
* The IPv6 privacy extensions are now enabled by default and handling of
    the ip6-privacy sysctl has been improved.
* Activating a Bond, Bridge or Team device can now optionally activate the
    slave connections as well. The behavior is controlled with
    'connection.autoconnect-slaves' property and AUTOCONNECT-SLAVES key in
    ifcfg files.
* The platform support code has been refactored, resulting in better
    scalability in large configurations.
* Changes to network interfaces configuration done outside NetworkManager
    are now picked up and exposed to the user via NetworkManager API and tools.
* A connection can now optionally leave externally configured default route
    in place instead of overriding it. The behavior is controlled with
    'ipv4.never-default' and 'ipv6.never-default' properties.
* nmcli allows multiple devices for 'nmcli device disconnect/delete'.
* Firewall zone is added to firewalld for device-based VPN connections too.
* Wi-Fi devices now indicate support for 2GHz and 5GHz frequencies
* "nmcli device" output now indicates physical port ID
* New config items added to the 'ifcfg-rh' plugin:
  - IPV4_ROUTE_METRIC and IPV6_ROUTE_METRIC
  - DEVTIMEOUT
  - IPADDR and PREFIX are now supported for specifying address ranges of
      shared IPv4 connections
* Dispatcher scripts now get a CONNECTION_FILENAME variable with the path
    to the configuration file for the connection
* An example dispatcher script that is able to apply complex routing rules
    (such as setting up policy-based routing) for 'ifcfg-rh' connections was
    added to examples/dispatcher/.
* 'mode' key of Bond device options property now accepts numeric values
* Connection attempts for devices without carrier on startup now wait for
    carrier to appear within a short timeout instead of failing
    immediately. This makes system startup more robust.
* Bridge connectivity is now properly restored on resume from suspend
* The D-Bus name is acquired earlier during the daemon startup. This makes
    it possible for the systemd service manager to optimize the service
    startup so that services that require networking are activated sooner
    contributing to faster system start up time.
* A lot of memory leak problems were fixed, resulting in reduced memory usage.
    Many of them were discovered as a result of improvements in use of
    Valgrind in the testing infrastructure.
* Management of 'teamd' daemon instances for Team devices is now more robust.
* The 'dnsmasq' daemon respawns when it terminates and it is configured for
    management of DNS resolver configuration
* Hostnames that are not fully qualified are no longer sent to a DHCPv6
    server for a dynamic DNS update
* Connection UUIDs are now checked for uniqueness when connection
    configurations are read
* Receipt of a NDP Router Advertisement can no longer lower the IPv6 hop
    limit (CVE-2015-2924)
